## General info

This app was created to simplify pasting Czech products' descriptions to PIM. It displays desctiption with HTML elements. When it detects "key features" ("klíčové vlastnosti" or "klíčové funkce"), it switches the paragraph to H2 and the remaining paragraphs after it to unordered list items. This was the way it needed to work to fulfil all the necessary requirements.

## Technologies

Project is created with:

- HTML 5
- CSS 3
- JavaScript ES6
